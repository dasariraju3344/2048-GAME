# 2048-GAME

2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048; however, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers. It was originally written in JavaScript and CSS, and released on 9 March 2014. But myself recreated this game using Python with my project guidance.`
